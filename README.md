Remember to include all online resources (other than information learned in lecture or section and android documentation) such as Stack Overflow, other blogs, students in this class, or TAs and instructors who helped you during Office Hours. If you did not use any such resources, please state so explicitly.

Answer here: I used extensive Flutter documentation and the opening lecture material about how Dart functions. I did ask one student who had already implemented the circular button widget for advice on how to get a circle border, but I don't recall that student's name. They advised me to add a shape paramter and call on the CircleBorder() widget. I really wanted to keep this project to grassroots and not go out looking for external resources just so I could figure out my own aptitude with Flutter and do the entire "trial by fire" thing. Coming out of it, I'd say that was the right decision given my how much I learned.

## Reflection Prompts

### New Learnings
What new tools, techniques, or other skills did you learn while doing this assignment?

How do you think you might use what you learned in the future?

Answer here: Every single thing I did was new. I had extensive experience with HTML and CSS, so I knew how styling and developing a webpage works. This, however, was very different. One would imagine the Widget ecosystem in Flutter is similar to HTML tags, but they took me a while to get used to. Their so useful in that they have all the functionality you need, and all you have to do is reference a Widget class. The tradeoff here though is that widgets have certain parameters, so styling gets a bit restrictive. Learning how to do the margin, padding, and semantics were probably the toughest part because Dart 101 offered no prep for those things (they are Flutter specific). Eventually I figured out how to integrate these together without throwing the entire styling of the project off. These are obviously concepts we will use heavily later on with other projects, so it was good for me to get a good feel for them now. 

## Challenges
What was hard about doing this assignment?
What did you learn from working through those challenges?
How could the assignment be improved for future years?

Answer here: I wouldn't say it was neccessarily hard. It was new. With everything new comes extensive exploration and discovery. Given that it was our first Flutter project, I'd say it had good guildelines and din't expect too much of us when it came to having the tools to be creative. What we were asked to do had extensive documentation and did not require too much thinking. I grew my entire knowledge base when it came to Flutter, and I'm certain that even if I don't have the tools right now, if asked to create something with little to no guidelines, I could figure it out within the context of Flutter's implementation. Overall, great assignment that achieved exactly what it was meant to do. 

### Mistakes 
What is one mistake that you made or misunderstanding that you had while you were completing this assignment? 

What is something that you learned or will change in the future as a result of this mistake or misunderstanding?

Answer here: When I first added the Semantics, it threw the styling of the buttons way off and everything was all over the place. I guess the Widget tree has a lot more intricacy then I orginally thought. Certain widgets expect certain children and styling is applied selectively to specific widgets. Once you start messing with the natural order, everything gets shifted out of whack. Going forward, I'd like to draw out the widget tree and see where I'm applying certain things to see how different elements intermesh.
